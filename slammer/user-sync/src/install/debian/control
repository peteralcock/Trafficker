Description: SlammerSync
 SYNC offers a powerful transformation engine, based on a scripting language,
 to easily manipulate data on the fly. Various identity management functions 
 are included for directory-specific compatibility - most notably Active Directory
 (changing passwords, account status, last logon, etc ...). SYNC is an open source
 project written in Java, available under the BSD license.
