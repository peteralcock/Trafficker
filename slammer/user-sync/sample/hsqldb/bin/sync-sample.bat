# SlammerSync provides tools to synchronize electronic
# identities from a list of data sources including any database with a JDBC
# connector, another LDAP directory, flat files...
#
# SYNC automatically embeds HSQLDB library. So, this script can:
# - Create a table from a CSV file header in a HSQLDB database;
# - Inject CSV data into a HSQLDB database;
# - Read data from a HSQLDB database table.
