# Slammer #

A collection of micro-services that allows developers to centralize authentication as a RESTful HTTP proxy into LDAP-compatible cloud/on-premises directory systems such as Microsoft Active Directory. It makes use of CAS for enterprise single sign-on, which is an open and well-documented authentication protocol. It also has a user sync application and a web-portal application which can heirarchy authenicated service chains, allowing for the use of multiple credential sources and types.

For more information, including instructions on LDAP, Active Directory, the CAS protocal, and setting up Slammer for getting all these things to play nicely with one another for the purposes of your applications, please <a href="https://github.com/eclecticlabs/slammer/wiki">visit the wiki</a>.
